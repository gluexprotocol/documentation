These modules are continuously developed and refined by a dedicated group of developers, known as \"gluers,\" who participate in focused weekly development sessions called \"glueing sprints.\" GlueX Modules can be reused across blockchains and intent auctions.  Hence, a module only needs to be onboarded once. The process is designed to ensure adaptability and continuous improvement.\nGlueX Protocol Modules\n\nOnce completed, these modules are compiled into comprehensive SDKs that power a suite of GlueX services, including Exchange Rates, Quote, Solve, and Bridge APIs. This modular architecture allows GlueX to adapt quickly to the demands of an evolving blockchain ecosystem while maintaining a focus on delivering reliable and efficient services.\nHandling Execution Requests in GlueX\nExecution requests to GlueX services, such as Quote, Solve, or Bridge APIs, are processed through a competitive network of optimizers. These optimizers leverage proprietary smart order routing algorithms, supported by the GlueX Optimize SDK, to identify the best execution strategies. \nGlueX Optimizers Network\n\nThe GlueX ecosystem ensures fairness by providing all optimizers access to the same liquidity sources, which are pre-integrated as GlueX Liquidity Modules. This uniformity creates a level playing field where optimizers must excel in speed, precision, and algorithmic innovation to gain an advantage. By fostering competition among optimizers, GlueX drives performance improvements and provides MEV protection guarantees. Users benefit from fast, accurate, and optimal execution of their transactions, even in the context of high-throughput blockchain environments.\nMitigating Maximum Extractable Value (MEV)\nMaximum Extractable Value (MEV) represents the portion of a transaction’s value that external parties can exploit due to inefficiencies in execution. GlueX Protocol addresses this issue by targeting three critical areas: liquidity access, optimization, and execution safeguards.\nGlueX mitigates MEV risks by rapidly integrating new liquidity sources. Its streamlined design ensures that every potential liquidity source is identified and utilized promptly, reducing the chances of missing valuable opportunities. With a robust network of optimizers, GlueX finds the most efficient execution routes, minimizing inefficiencies and ensuring optimal use of available liquidity. \nTo safeguard transactions during execution, GlueX employs advanced mechanisms such as automatically computed slippage tolerance values. These measures protect users from issues like front-running, back-running, and sandwiching attacks while also minimizing the risk of transaction reverts. \n"},"gluex-protocol/gluex-modules/":{"url":"gluex-protocol/gluex-modules/","title":"GlueX Modules","keywords":"","body":"GlueX Modules\nAt the core of GlueX is the concept of \"GlueX Modules\", which act as the essential building blocks for integrating various components needed to interact with decetralized financial applications.

All this while simplifying the development process and improving performance considerably!\nGlueX Protocol Modules\n\nThe GlueX Workflow: From Intent to Settlement\nIn the GlueX ecosystem, a entity’s intent—such as executing a swap or any other financial transaction—flows seamlessly through four core modules. Each module plays a critical role in ensuring the entire process is executed efficiently and securely. The following section illustrates how these modules work together to fulfill the entity's request:\nOriginator Module:\nThe process begins when the Originator Module receives an intent from an entity's DApp. This module abstracts the settlement protocol by collecting all the necessary details, such as the tokens to be swapped, the source and destination blockchains, and protocol-specific metadata. It acts as the gateway for the entity’s request into the GlueX ecosystem, converting it into a standardized format that can be processed by the subsequent modules.\nIntent Module:\nOnce the Originator Module passes the data to the Intent Module, the data is abstracted into a standardized GlueX intent object. This abstraction ensures that the entity’s request can be understood and processed in a unified way across all modules, irrespective of the originating protocol. The Intent Module is responsible for ensuring that complex trade logic, such as routing, multiple order types, and cross-chain transactions, are handled seamlessly while preserving the entity’s original intent across all steps.\nBlockchain Module:\nThe Blockchain Module is where GlueX adapts to the specifics of different blockchain environments. It abstracts the complexities of interacting with various blockchains, providing a unified interface for all supported networks. It handles the complexities of each blockchain’s metadata, native tokens, operational nuances, and transaction requirements, ensuring seamless compatibility across multiple networks.\nLiquidity Module:\nThe Liquidity Module abstracts the process of sourcing liquidity on each blockchain. It identifies and accesses the relevant liquidity of LPs across different protocols. The module abstracts the path to liquidity by considering factors such as liquidity pool availability, fees, and slippage, ensuring that the swap is executed efficiently. \nOnce the appropriate liquidity sources are identified, the process flows back through the Blockchain Module, where the necessary blockchain details are finalized. The Intent Module ensures that the data remains consistent, and the Originator Module completes the settlement by executing the transaction on-chain.\nCurious to learn more?

This API should provide comprehensive details about each order, including tokens involved, amounts, deadlines, and any unique order parameters.\nThe API should support high availability and efficient querying to handle the potential volume and frequency of requests made by GlueX.\n\n\nProtocol Metadata:\nEach order fetched through the API should include all relevant metadata necessary for execution. This includes blacklisted tokens/pools, fee structures, slippage tolerances, expiration times, security deposits and any cosigner conditions.\n\n\nContract Details:\nThe protocol must provide comprehensive details about the on-chain contracts used for executing settlements. This includes:\nSettlement Contract: For solo-chain intents, the protocol must specify the settlement contract address and interface, which handles direct on-chain swaps or transfers within a single blockchain.\nEscrow Contracts (Optional for Bridge Intents): For cross-chain operations, the protocol should detail escrow contracts used to lock funds securely until conditions for release are met. These escrow contracts must handle deposit and withdrawal actions in a secure, atomic manner to facilitate cross-chain settlements.\n\n\nThe protocol should ensure these contracts are well-documented, including their ABI and any nuances involved in interacting with them, to allow GlueX seamless integration and interaction.\n\n\n\nThe requirements below are optional, but they would enable a smoother integration:\n\nSecurity and Solvability Measures:\nThe protocol must implement mechanisms for solvability checks, ensuring that orders can be fulfilled without risk of failure. This may involve exposing services that validate liquidity availability or support pre-execution checks.\n\n\nRate and Pricing Information:\nIf the settlement protocol provides its own pricing or exchange rate service, particularly if your settlement protocol is a bridge-intent protocol, it should make these rates available for GlueX to fetch and use in its decision-making processes. Accurate and timely rate information ensures that orders are priced correctly and executed efficiently.\n\n\nCross-Chain Intents/ Bridge support (if applicable):\nFor protocols operating on multiple chains, we will appreciate documentation on how cross-chain transactions are handled, including any relayer services or secret hashing mechanisms used for secure fund transfers.\nThe protocol should define processes for unlocking assets and managing cross-chain liquidity securely.\n\n\n\nIf your protocol uses different mechanisms, we can still integrate it with some adjustments of course :)\n"},"gluex-protocol/gluex-modules/gluex-liquidity-modules.html":{"url":"gluex-protocol/gluex-modules/gluex-liquidity-modules.html","title":"GlueX Liquidity Modules","keywords":"","body":"GlueX Liquidity Modules\nWhat's a GlueX Liquidity Module?\nA GlueX Liquidity Module is an integral component of the GlueX SDK.
