# GlueX Router API [BETA]

> **Note:** GlueX Router API is currently in beta. We welcome your feedback to help us refine every detail and ensure it meets the highest quality standards you expect from GlueX Protocol products.

**GlueX Router API** is a powerful and flexible tool designed for developers to implement efficient on-chain interaction logic across multiple supported blockchains. Whether youâ€™re building a DeFi application or optimizing cross-chain workflows, the API provides everything you need for seamless integration.

## Key Features

- **Multi-Chain Support**: Operates seamlessly across a wide range of blockchains.
- **Comprehensive DeFi Protocol Coverage**: Supports DEXs, lending, yield farming, staking, and more.
- **Fast Response Times**: Average round-trip time of ~500ms.

- **Positive Slippage Rewards**: All positive slippage is returned to the user.
- **Dynamic Fee Structure**: Transparent, volume-based routing fees.

## Fee Schedule

Unlike other routers that retain positive slippage as hidden fees, GlueX Router returns all positive slippage directly to users. During volatile markets, this can result in significant savings.

### Transaction Fees
GlueX Router uses a dynamic fee structure based on the transaction value:

| **Intent Value Size**       | **Fee Rate** |
|-----------------------------|--------------|
| `< $1,000`                  | **0.04%**    |
| `$1,000 - $10,000`          | **0.03%**    |
| `$10,000 - $20,000`         | **0.02%**    |
| `> $20,000`                 | **0.01%**    |

### Partner Discounts
Frequent users benefit from reduced fees based on 30-day cumulative transaction volumes:

| **30d Value Settled**        | **Routing Fee Rate** |
|------------------------------|----------------------|
| `< $100,000`                | **0.04%**           |
| `$100,000 - $200,000`       | **0.03%**           |
| `$200,000 - $300,000`       | **0.02%**           |
| `> $300,000`                | **0.01%**           |

**Pro Tip:** Consistent activity ensures the lowest routing fee for all trades, regardless of size.
